What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension provides a library of functions useful for front-end
plug-ins as well as for back-end modules. It currently is mostly used
in extensions by Oliver Klee, but it is free to be used by every
extension author.

This extension includes the functionality of the  *salutationswitcher*
extension and thus obsoletes that extension.
